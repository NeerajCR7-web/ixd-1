# Ontario Parks Project üèïÔ∏è
A comprehensive camping platform for discovering, booking, and discussing Ontario Parks.

## Overview
Ontario Parks Explorer is a full-stack-inspired web application designed to help outdoor enthusiasts discover campsites, book reservations, and engage with a community of fellow campers. The project focuses on:
